# Barcode Scanner
You can check more info on the docs: https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner

In order to use this feature, you have to install the plugin:
```sh
$ ionic plugin add phonegap-plugin-barcodescanner --save --variable CAMERA_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="To scan barcodes"
```

Important note: Since iOS 10 it's mandatory to add a `NSCameraUsageDescription` in the info.plist.

`NSCameraUsageDescription` describes the reason that the app accesses the userâ€™s camera. When the system prompts the user to allow access, this string is displayed as part of the dialog box.

This entry is passed on the `--variable` flag on plugin install.


In case you want to support low end/old devices, make sure to install crosswalk:
```sh
$ ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview
```

You can either try it out on a device or try it using an emulator:
```sh
$ ionic build android
$ adb install -r platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-armv7-debug.apk
```
